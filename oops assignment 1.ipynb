    "'''Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.\n",
    "It enables code reuse, promotes code organization, and establishes relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a class inherits attributes and methods from a single base class. It represents an \"is-a\" relationship between the derived class (subclass) and\n",
    "the base class (superclass). For example:'''\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def eat(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal is eating.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Dog is barking.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.eat()   # Output: Animal is eating.\n",
    "dog.bark()  # Output: Dog is barking.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "In this example, the `Dog` class inherits the `eat()` method from the `Animal` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a class inherits attributes and methods from multiple base classes. It allows a class to inherit from more than one class and combine their features. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Car is driving.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Boat:\n",
    "    def sail(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Boat is sailing.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class AmphibiousVehicle(Car, Boat):\n",
    "    def operate(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Amphibious vehicle is operating.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "vehicle = AmphibiousVehicle()\n",
    "vehicle.drive()  # Output: Car is driving.\n",
    "vehicle.sail()   # Output: Boat is sailing.\n",
    "vehicle.operate()  # Output: Amphibious vehicle is operating.\n",
    "```\n",
    "'''\n",
    "In this example, the `AmphibiousVehicle` class inherits from both the `Car` and `Boat` classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multilevel Inheritance: In multilevel inheritance, a class inherits from a derived class, which in turn inherits from another class. It represents a hierarchical structure of inheritance. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def move(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Vehicle is moving.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Car is driving.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class SportsCar(Car):\n",
    "    def race(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Sports car is racing.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "sports_car = SportsCar()\n",
    "sports_car.move()  # Output: Vehicle is moving.\n",
    "sports_car.drive()  # Output: Car is driving.\n",
    "sports_car.race()  # Output: Sports car is racing.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "In this example, the `SportsCar` class inherits from the `Car` class, which itself inherits from the `Vehicle` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hierarchical Inheritance: In hierarchical inheritance, multiple derived classes inherit from a single base class. It represents a branching inheritance structure. For example:\n",
    "'''\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def eat(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Animal is eating.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Dog is barking.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def meow(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Cat is meowing.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.eat()   # Output: Animal is eating.\n",
    "dog.bark()  # Output: Dog is barking.\n",
    "\n",
    "cat = Cat()\n",
    "cat.eat()   # Output: Animal is eating.\n",
    "cat.meow()  # Output: Cat is meowing.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "In this example, both the `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit the `eat()` method from the `Animal` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples illustrate the different types of inheritance—single inheritance, multiple inheritance, multilevel inheritance, and hierarchical inheritance—each demonstrating a specific\n",
    "relationship between the derived and base classes."
